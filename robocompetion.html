                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Registration for all competitions is available through our online portal. Robo Club members can register with their membership ID for discounted fees. Non-members can also participate by filling out the general registration form and paying the standard entry fee. Registration typically opens 4 weeks before the competition and closes 1 week prior to the event date. Team registrations require information for all team members.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Most competitions are open to undergraduate and graduate students. Some events have specific divisions for different experience levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced). High school students may participate in certain competitions with parental consent. For team-based competitions, all team members must be enrolled students, though they can be from different institutions. Some advanced competitions may require participants to have previous experience or to have qualified through preliminary rounds.</p>

                            <p>For most competitions, participants are required to bring their own robots and equipment. The Robo Club provides the competition arena, power outlets, and basic tools. For competitions like Circuit Debugging, we provide the circuit boards and components. CAD Modeling requires participants to bring their own laptops with installed software. We recommend checking the specific equipment requirements for each competition, which are detailed on the competition registration page.</p>

                            <p>Yes, all competitions offer prizes for top performers. Typically, first, second, and third place winners receive trophies and certificates. Many competitions also include cash prizes or sponsored awards from industry partners. The prize pool varies by competition, with major events offering larger rewards. Additionally, exceptional participants may receive special recognition or invitations to represent the university at national-level competitions. All participants receive a certificate of participation, and special awards are given for innovation and technical excellence.</p>

                            <p>Yes, you can register for multiple competitions during the same event, provided there are no scheduling conflicts. We design the competition schedule to minimize overlaps between events. If you're participating in multiple competitions, you'll receive a discounted registration fee for additional events. However, we recommend carefully considering your capacity to prepare for multiple events, as each competition requires significant preparation and focus. For team-based competitions, team composition may vary between different events.</p>

                            <p>The Robo Club offers several resources to help participants prepare. We host weekly workshop sessions where you can learn relevant skills and techniques. For each competition, detailed rules and guidelines are available on our website. We also organize pre-competition practice sessions where you can test your robots in conditions similar to the actual competition. Additionally, mentors and previous winners are available for consultation during designated office hours. We recommend starting your preparation at least 4-6 weeks before the competition date.</p>

                            <p>Judging criteria vary by competition type. For performance-based competitions like Line Follower and Robo Race, results are based on objective measures such as completion time and accuracy. For design-oriented competitions like CAD Modeling, judging includes creativity, technical complexity, practicality, and presentation quality. All judging panels include faculty members and industry professionals. The complete judging criteria for each competition are provided in the competition handbook, which is shared with all registered participants two weeks before the event.</p>
